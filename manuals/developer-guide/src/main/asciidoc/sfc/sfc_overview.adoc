=== OpenDaylight Service Function Chaining (SFC) Overiew

OpenDaylight Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides the ability to define an ordered list of a network services (e.g. firewalls, load balancers). These service are then "stitched" together in the network to create a service chain. This project provides the infrastructure (chaining logic, APIs) needed for ODL to provision a service chain in the network and an end-user application for defining such chains.
