== Reservation Developer Guide

=== Overview
The Reservation Project provides a model extension that allows for realisation of 
time based constraints in Intents or Policy work.

NOTE: To be clear the target audience for this guide is a developer who
will be _using_ the feature to build something separate, but _not_
somebody who will be developing code for this feature itself.

=== Reservation Project Architecture
TODO: provide Reservation architecture when we have a better idea what the
final (at least for Lithium) model will look like.

=== Reservation Model
TODO: Describe the agreed-upon model and the thus the generated APIs.

=== API Reference Documentation
TODO: Provide links to to how to get to the RESTCONF APIdoc and to the
generated Javadoc from the YANG generated Java code.
