=== Target Environment

==== For Execution

OpenDaylight runs on any Java 7 - or Java 8 - compliant JVM; however, certain Karaf features may have additional requirements, which are cited in the release notes for projects that use those features. If you are using an Oracle JDK, use version 1.7.0_45 or later. Please refer to links below.

Features with additional requirements are:

* BGPCEP depends on TCPMD5 so requires 64-bit Linux
* SDN depends on BGPCEP, which in turn depends onTCPMD5 so it also requires 64-bit Linux
* TCPMD5 - Requires 64-bit Linux
* TSDR - Has extended requirements for external databases
* SFC -  Requires addition features for certain configurations
* SXP - Depends on TCPMD5 so requires 64-bit Linux
* SNBI - Has requirements for Linux and Docker
* OpFlex - Requires Linux
* DLUX - Requires a current web browser to view the UI
* AAA - Has additional requirements for external tools when using federation

==== For Developers

OpenDaylight is written primarily in Java and uses Maven as a build tool. The main requirements for developing features within OpenDaylight are the following: 

* A Java 7- or Java 8-compliant JDK
* Maven 3.1.1 or later 

Note: Applications and tools built on top of OpenDaylight using its REST APIs should have no special requirements beyond that needed to run the application or tool and make the REST calls. 

Note: In some places, OpenDaylight uses the Xtend language, and while Maven will download the appropriate tools to build this, additional plugins may be required for IDE support. 

=== Known Issues and Limitations

Other than as noted in specific projectsâ€™ release notes that are listed below, we know of the following limitations: 

* Migration from Lithium to Beryllium has not been extensively tested. The project release notes include migration and compatibility information when it is known. 
* OpenDaylight has been unreliable at very high scales when collecting flow statistics from OpenFlow switches. These issues became apparent in tests when managing thousands of OpenFlow switches, but outcomes may vary depending on deployment and use cases.
