== Overview 
The implementation aims at making the ODL with VTN features to act as a network service provider for OpenStack. VTN Will use the OVSDB southbound services as well as the neutron interface for this implementation. The following are the key features of this implementation.

* When OpenStack starts up (with ODL settings enabled), By default the ODL IP address will be added as controller and manager of the OVS in the OpenStack Server.
  The neutron interface is notified and a VTN with a Vbridge is created. 

  VTN Manager is notified by the OVS plugin on any new changes to the OpenVSwitch 
  in the OpenStack environment. 

  The implementation will ensure that br-int bridge is added and the physical interface 
  is mapped to it.

* When a new VM gets added, VTN Manager gets notified from the OVSDB plugin on the addition/modification of the new port. VTN Manager creates a Vbridge interface and based on the port information creates a port map for the interface.

* Whenever a new VM is created from OpenStack, a new interface is added to the br-int bridge to add the new host, VTN implementation is notified on any changes by the OVSDB Plugin and appropriate port mapping is created in VTN to ensure the network service.

* Now any new packet the OVS will send the Packet to the ODL controller,Since the port mapping is enabled, VTN Manager will install Flow Entries to ensure connectivity.

* The implementation makes use of a configuration file in the opendaylight configuration directory. the name of the bridge in Openstack OVS, the physical interface device name to be used for VM's are mentioned in this file. If the file ins not found, the following default values are assumed
    bridgename=br-int 
    failmode=secure 
    protocols=OpenFlow10 
    portname=ens33
