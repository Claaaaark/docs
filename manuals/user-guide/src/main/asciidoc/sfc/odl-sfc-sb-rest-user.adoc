=== SFC Southbound REST Plugin

==== Overview
The Southbound REST Plugin is used to send configuration from DataStore down to
network devices supporting a REST API (i.e. they have a configured REST URI).
It supports POST/PUT/DELETE operations, which are triggered accordingly by
changes in the SFC data stores.

.In its current state it listens to changes in these SFC data stores:
* Access Control List (ACL)
* Service Classifier Function (SCF)
* Service Function (SF)
* Service Function Group (SFG)
* Service Function Schedule Type (SFST)
* Service Function Forwader (SFF)
* Rendered Service Path (RSP)

==== Southbound REST Plugin Architecture
From the user perspective, the REST plugin is another SFC Southbound plugin
used to communicate with network devices.
